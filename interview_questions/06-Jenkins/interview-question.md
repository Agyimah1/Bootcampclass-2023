## What is the difference between a freestyle project and a pipeline in Jenkins?
A freestyle project in Jenkins is a traditional approach to building, testing, and deploying software where you configure the steps manually through the web interface.
A pipeline, on the other hand, is a more modern approach that uses code (usually in the form of a Jenkinsfile) to define and automate the steps of a software delivery process.
