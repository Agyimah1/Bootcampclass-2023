DevOps Workflow In Companies 
**Some of the Tools Mentioned in this workflow may not be used in united Core, but just familiarize yourself with them.**

The DevOps workflow in companies typically involves a series of stages or phases that facilitate the development, testing, deployment, 
and monitoring of software applications. Below is an overview of the typical flow of DevOps practices used in companies, along with examples: 

1. Version Control: 
o Description: Developers use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage and track changes to the source code. 
o Example: Developers commit code changes to a shared Git repository, allowing for collaboration and version history tracking. 

2. Continuous Integration (CI): 
o Description: Automated building and testing of code changes occur whenever developers commit to the version control system. 
o Example: Jenkins or GitLab CI automatically triggers a build and runs unit tests whenever code is pushed to a specific branch. 

3. Artifact Management: 
o Description: Build artifacts (e.g., compiled binaries, packages) are stored in an artifact repository for versioning and reuse. 
o Example: Artifactory or Nexus is used to store and manage artifacts generated during the CI process. 

4. Automated Testing: 
o Description: Various types of automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests) are run to ensure code quality and functionality. 
o Example: JUnit for Java unit tests, Selenium for web application testing, and Mocha for JavaScript testing. 

5. Continuous Deployment (CD): 
o Description: Automated deployment of applications to staging or production environments after successful testing. 
o Example: Deployment pipelines in tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI are configured to deploy applications automatically based on predefined conditions. 

6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): 
o Description: Infrastructure is defined and provisioned through code, ensuring consistency across different environments. 
o Example: Terraform or Ansible scripts define and manage infrastructure components, such as servers and networking. 

7. Configuration Management: 
o Description: Configuration management tools automate the setup and maintenance of system configurations. 
o Example: Puppet or Chef scripts manage and enforce system configurations on servers. 

8. Monitoring and Logging: 
o Description: Continuous monitoring and logging capture metrics, errors, and events to ensure application health. 
o Example: Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for visualization, and the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis. 

9. Continuous Feedback: 
o Description: Continuous feedback loops are established to gather information on application performance and user satisfaction. 
o Example: User feedback is collected through tools like New Relic or customer support systems, influencing future development iterations. 

10. Release Management: 
o Description: Efficient release management processes handle versioning, rollbacks, and communication plans. 
o Example: Use of feature flags and gradual rollouts in tools like LaunchDarkly or Rollout.io to control feature releases and minimize risks. 

11. Collaboration and Communication: 
o Description: Collaboration tools facilitate communication and coordination among development, operations, and other teams. 
o Example: Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence support communication, issue tracking, and collaboration. 

12. Security Practices: 
o Description: Security is integrated throughout the DevOps lifecycle, with automated security testing and vulnerability scanning. 
o Example: Tools like OWASP ZAP for security testing and Trivy for container image scanning help identify and address security issues. 

This DevOps workflow ensures a streamlined and automated process from code development to deployment and monitoring, fostering collaboration between 
development and operations teams. The specific tools and practices employed may vary depending on the organization's needs and technology stack.
The key goal is to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery while maintaining a focus on quality, security, and continuous improvement.
